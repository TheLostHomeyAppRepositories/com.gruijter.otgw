Manage and monitor your boiler via OpenTherm Gateway and MQTT.

The OpenTherm Gateway is placed between your thermostat and your Central Heater. It provides real time monitoring of many sensors and temperatures in your central heating system. It also allows you to control several advanced settings (USE AT OWN RISK!)

The OpenTherm GateWay is an open source device. It can be built by yourself, or purchased online (E.g. nodo-shop.nl). The firmware used to develop the Homey app was written by https://github.com/rvdbreemen
